# Getting started: Basic Site

R Markdown websites like this one can be built with a minimum of two files: a `_site.yml` and an `index.Rmd`. 

The `_site.yml` file controls the overall structure of the website, such as the order of the navigation bar and the color theme. 

When these files are _rendered_ into HTML files, they can be hosted on GitHub for free. Then after turning on a few settings in your GitHub repository (repo) these files can be viewed as a magnificent webpage. 

We are going to employ the "[GitHub first, R Studio second](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html)" approach. 

### 1. Create a public Github repo. 
* From your *Repository* page, click the green <span style="color:green">[NEW]</span> button.  
* (_Suggestion_): Name this repo something like `ichps_website` so you know it's a playground.
* keep it a PUBLIC repo
* YES initialize with a README

Click 'Create Repository' to finish, but keep this page open. We'll come back to it a few times.

### 2. Create a project in R Studio and clone your new repo into this project. 
* Top right corner in R Studio click: *New Project --> Checkout from version control --> Git*
* Go back to GitHub, and click on the green <span style="color:green">[Clone or Download]</span> button.
  - Click the clipboard icon to copy the URL to your repo. 
  - Paste this URL into the _Repository URL_ box in R Studio. 
    * **(_Strongly Suggested_)**: Name this project the same as the repo name.
    * Subdirectory: Your path, your choice. Just don't put a repo inside a repo. 
* Click _Create Project_

### 3. Create necessary files in R Studio.

* In the *Terminal* window (tab to the right of the *Console*), create the `_site.yml` and `index.Rmd` files using the `touch` command. Type the following commands in the Terminal one at a time, pressing <kbd>Return</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> after each line to execute. 
```
touch _site.yml
touch index.rmd
```
You can view these files in the _File_ pane (lower left). You can open supported file types by clicking on the name of the file from this pane. 

* Open both the `_site.yml` and `index.Rmd` files now. 

### 4. Configuring the `_site.yml` file. 
This is the file that controls your overall site's configuration. If you are familiar with R Markdown files, this is the same type of 'language' that is used in the header area to control the document structure. 

YAML headers, and this file, are very particular about spacing and tabs. To avoid unnecessary grief we are going to copy/paste code from Chapter 10.5.1 of the [bookdown website](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html). 


* Navigate to the bookdown website by clicking the link above. 
* Mouse over the first code chunk in section 10.5.1, and click the _Copy to Clipboard_ icon in the top right corner. 
* Paste this code into your `_site.yml` file. 
* Remove lines 7 and 8 since right now we don't have an "About" page. 
* Give your website a name and title!
* Add the following line on a new line `2` (between `name` and `navbar`).
    - This ensures that all rendered HTML files are saved in the top level directory. 

```
output_dir: "."
```

### 5. Configure your index page. 

This is your landing page. That is, the first page people see when they go to your website. You can add a title to this page using a YAML header as is shown in the bookdown website, or you can use a pound sign `#` as a first level header to make this title. 

* Create a title for your page using *either* a YAML header or a `#` sign. Using both is redundant. 
* Write a sentence or two welcoming your viewers to your website. 

### 6. Building & previewing your website locally. 

Since we created the `.yml` file manually after creating the R Project, your project doesn't quite know yet that it has a website to build. 

* Save your work and close down R studio. 
* Navigate to your repository folder on your computer, and open the project by double clicking on the R project file icon (a cube with the letter R). 
    - _Note: This is always how you should open your R Project files_

There should now be a **BUILD** tab in the top right pane.

* Click this tab, and then click the _Build Website_ button. 

An HTML file should now appear in your viewer pane. 

* Click the 'Show in new window' button to see your site in a full browser window. 


#### Notes, Tips and Comments - 

* Clicking "Build Website" will render every `.md` and `.Rmd` file in your top level project folder into an HTML file. 
    - This is important to keep in mind when creating a website with a lot of pages. 
    - Code files in sub-folders will not be automatically rendered. 
* You can re-render individual files by clicking 'Knit'. 
* You can leave this browser window open as you work, refreshing the page to see new changes. 
* There are some basic themes you can app

```
output:
  html_document:
    theme: readable
    highlight: pygments
```    

> Try this now: Make a change to your `index.Rmd`, knit and refresh your browser window. 
 
### 7. Push to GitHub & publish your website. 

Let's get your test site up for the world to see. 

* In the _Terminal_ window, stage and commit your files to version control by executing the following commands:

```
git add -A 
```

This will _stage_ all files that have been changed and/or added. _Staging_ is the process of adding a file to be tracked under version control. 

```
git commit -m "first commit"
```

Every commit needs a message. Try to make it informative, yet brief. 

```
git push
```

This will _push_ your changes up to GitHub's servers online. You may have to enter your github username and password here. See [happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html) for help storing your github credentials. 

* Go back to your GitHub repo page and refresh - you should now see that your repo now contains the new code, and HTML files that you have been working on. 
* Click _Settings_ in the top right of the navigation bar in your repository. 
    - Scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section. 
    - Under _Source_, select _Master branch_. (_Note: [Chapter 3.3 of the bookdown manual](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/github-pages.html) has instructions for publishing something other than the top level folder for a repo, such as a `public` folder_)
    
After the page refreshes, you will see the URL to your website in at the top of GitHub pages section. 

* Click on this link to see what your public facing website looks like!
* Copy this URL, we're going to paste it in the repo settings so it can be found easy. 
* Go back to your main repo page by clicking on the name of your repo at the top of the GitHub page. 
    - Click **Edit**
    - Add a short description, and paste the URL into the _Website_ field. 


### 8. Adding Content. 

Let's add an example analysis project to showcase on our website. 

* Go back to R Studio. 
    - Create a new R Markdown file using _File -> New R Markdown_ so we can get the example R Markdown content that includes a plot. 
    - Save this file with a name such as `project.Rmd`
    - Knit this file to produce a HTML file. 
* Add a link to the project HTML page to your `_site.yml` configuration file by adding a new `text` line. Be mindful about the spacing here. 

```
    - text: "My Projects"
      href: project.html
```

* Rebuild your website by clicking the _Build Website_ button in the _Build_ tab in the top right pane.
* View your changes locally, make a change if you see fit. 
* Add your changes to version control from the Terminal: 

```
git add -A
git commit -m "add project"
git push
```

* Refresh your live webpage on GitHub to see the results!

# Next phase: Blog Aware

The "simple" website that was built above can be extended and enhanced well enough with some CSS and Rmarkdown wizardry. However, sometimes you may want a little more of a 'modern', 'dynamic' or 'responsive' feel, or to include a blog in your website. Here are some examples:  

* https://georgecushen.com/
* https://chicodatafest.netlify.com/
* http://datascience.csuchico.edu/


This is when we enter the realm of [[Hugo]](https://gohugo.io/), - the self proclaimed "most popular open-source static site generator". 

Hugo is it's own language, and for advanced usage of Hugo-based websites, some understanding of how Hugo works and reading _those_ docs may be required. 

For now, we are just going to show you how to get started in this realm of fancy-ness using the R package `blogdown`. Then you can go break it later. The super official blogdown documentation is linked in the References section at the bottom of this page.  

If you did not do so beforehand, install the `blogdown` package, and use it to install Hugo using `blogdown::install_hugo()`. 

### 1. Create a new Github Repo and connect it to an R Project. 

This is step 1 and 2 from the first part of this workshop. 

### 2. Create a new site with a specified theme

The `blogdown` package will setup the necessary files, folder structures and theme files from a pre-specified them that is available on github. The example we will start with below is from the github user `gcushen`, and the repository name is `hugo-academic`. We are also specifying that we want to see the example site provided by the theme author. This is highly recommended, after all we learn by copying and modifying!


```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_site(theme='gcushen/hugo-academic', theme_example=TRUE)
```

This could take up to a minute to download all necessary files. 

When it is done, your website will be rendered and appear in the bottom right viewer pane. Click the 'Show in new window' to open it in your full browser. The example site is a demo, so it may be a bit overwhelming at first. We'll work quickly to trim it down to something a bit more manageable. 


### 3. Explore configuration files. 
Let's start by looking at the files that are contained in the root folder of this project. 

* `config.toml`: Functions similar to the `_site.yml` file, but with a LOT of options and comments.
    - We won't work on this one just yet. 
* `index.Rmd`: There's nothing here! 

This is one of the primary differences between this type of site building and the one we just finished. Content is handled in a very different manner. Hugo + Blogdown aim to help you focus on content creation and these programs put the pieces together for you. Think of each piece of content (each "pane" or "window" on the demo site) as a "widget" that can configured individually and put together in your own style. 

### 4. Explore content files and simplify the site to start. 

* Open the `content/home` folder. Each one of these markdown (`.md`) files controls one piece of content. 
* Open the `demo.md` file. 
    - Flip back to the browser site and make sure you can identify which piece of content that this file controls. 
    - Turn this section off by setting `active=false` on line 8.
    - Save this file, then go back to your browser and refresh the page. Notice it automatically updates the page (Live Preview).
    
* Turn off the following pages: 
  - contact
  - accomplishments
  - hero
  - featured
  - experiencee
  - gallery/index.md
  
We won't have time to go through them all, and each theme is slightly different in how it manages content. Reading the theme documentation is essential. The above pages were chosen to turn off so we can focus on the basics for now. 

### 5. Start to modify little by little. 

The order content appears is controlled by the `weight` option - lower numbers are at the top. E.g. Default numbers are projects at 65, posts at 60, and skills at 30. 

* Set the weight of `skills.md` to 68, so it shows up after projects. 


### X. Blog posts

On your newly updated website, clicking on one of the posts opens that page in full page view. This is what your readers will see. 

The `home/posts.md` page controls the appearance of this section, but the content itself is in another location. 

* Open this file and make the following modifications and see the live changes. 
    - Under the `[content]` section, change `count=3` to show only 3 posts. 
    - Under the `[design]` section, change the `view` option to another number. 

The content files for posts are stored under `content/post/` folder. If you look there now you'll see some folders, a `.Rmd` file with it's associated `.html` output, and an `_index.md` file. 

**Creating new blog posts**

* Option 1: Copy the layout/format of one of the example files already in this folder
* Option 2: Use the R Studio Addins to setup the page structure for you. 
    - **This is the one we're going to use**
    - This will likely require you to install and/or update new packages including (but not limited to) 
    `fastmap`, `miniUI`, `htmltools`, `shiny`. 
    - If you run into seemingly endless package installation loops, restart RStudio and re-try. 
    
Using the UI allows you to easily set catgories, tags and the like. 

* Select the `.Rmd` format. 

HUGE YAML header material. Lots to customize here if you so choose. 
Content goes below the header, starting around line 19.

### Closing comments

* Hugo has a TON of themes: https://themes.gohugo.io/ . Not all work with `blogdown`, and not all are easy to work with. Here is a blog post by Peter Baumgartner on [important thoughts on choosing a theme to work with](https://portfolio.peter-baumgartner.net/2018/07/19/blogdown-using-themes/).
