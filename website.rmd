# Learning Objectives

* Recognize the minimal requirements to build a website using R and Markdown. 
* Build a basic level website using R and Markdown
* Publish this website to GitHub
* Become aware of how the `blogdown` R package can be used to create responsive websites
* Download and compile a starter website based on blogdown. 


# Software Setup
To participate in this workshop, you will need the software described below. 
In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser.


### Git & GitHub

Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your code on https://github.com. 

**Instructions to install Git can be found at** https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git

  
To share your code and publish your website you will also need a GitHub account at https://github.com. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage you to create a GitHub account prior to the workshop if you don't have one already. Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For example, you may want to review [these instructions for keeping your email address private](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/) provided at GitHub.

> Note: This workshop is not an lesson on git. We will use git to do a few things and we will interact with GitHub, but we will not go into details about version control. 

For more details on how to use git like a pro, see tutorials such as

* https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud
* https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
* https://happygitwithr.com/



### R & R Studio

[R](https://www.r-project.org) is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. 

* **Windows** ([Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU))

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from CRAN(https://cran.r-project.org/index.html).

* **macOS** ([Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ly3kyxwEg))

Install R by downloading and running <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg">this .pkg file</a> from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>. 

* **Linux**

You can download the binary files for your distribution from CRAN(https://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo dnf install R`). 

#### R Studio
To interact with R, we use the _Integrated Development Environment (IDE)_ [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). After you have R installed, please install the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.


> This also isn't a workshop on how to use R. Most of what we will do won't even be in the R language. However we will still use R Studio for ease of integration with GitHub, project management, and the integration of R code and markdown to produce webpages like the one you are looking at now. 


## R packages

* knitr
* Rmarkdown
* devtools
* blogdown

## Hugo
Hugo ((https://gohugo.io) is a static site generator, that is used by `blogdown` to create dynamic websites. `blogdown` has a helper function to do this installation for us. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::install_hugo()
```


# Getting started: Basic Site
