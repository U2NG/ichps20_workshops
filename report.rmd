This workshop uses material from the Software Carpentry lesson: R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis - [Producing Reports with knitr](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/15-knitr-markdown/index.html)

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teaches foundational coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide. [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/), and [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/) workshops are based on our lessons.
