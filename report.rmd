# Learning Objectives


* Understand the value of writing reproducible reports
* Learn how to recognise and compile the basic components of an R Markdown file
* Become familiar with R code chunks, and understand their purpose, structure and options
* Demonstrate the use of inline chunks for weaving R outputs into text blocks, for example when discussing the results of some calculations
* Be aware of alternative output formats to which an R Markdown file can be exported


This workshop uses material from the Software Carpentry lesson: R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis - [Producing Reports with knitr](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/15-knitr-markdown/index.html)

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teaches foundational coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide. [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/), and [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/) workshops are based on our lessons.
