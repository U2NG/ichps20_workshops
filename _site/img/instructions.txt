Pre-req:

* Knowledge of git and a Github account
* R and R Studio installed
-this tutorial uses R 3.6.1 and RMarkdown 1.18
* Packages: rmarkdown


0. Alternate path: clone my example_website repo
1. Start a new repo in github. 
- Add a readme so you can clone it right away. 
2. Open R Studio
- top right: Project - new - Version control - git
- back to github, green 'clone or download' - copy button. 
- paste into repository URL. 
- recommended to leave project directory name alone
- reminder: don't put a git inside a git. 
- also recommended to open in new session
- create project
3. Create files	
- download them from []
- From the terminal type: touch index.Rmd and touch _site.yml
- yaml files are picky about indenting and spacing
- Can do file-new rmarkdown, but then delete all the template text, and all the header code
4. Restart R so that you get the build tab
5. Edit index file to add content
6. Edit site.yml to add navbar and theme. 
  - if you didn't download this file directly (used touch), then use the copy icon to copy code. 
  - don't highlight/copy or you'll get incorrect spacing. 
7. build website - preview and approve
8. git add/commit/push to github
9. Back to github: time to deploy
  - settings -> github pages --> source: master branch
  - don't choose theme here. do that in your _site.yml file
  - page will refresh. scroll back down to github pages to see website URL
  - recommended to copy this URL and paste at the top of repo main page. 

---- need to show alterantive options if don't know git

--- closing notes
- file org. everything in main folder gets re-rendered when you build site
- so everything not in main folder won't be auto updated
- show link to themes (or at least html themes)
